# Blood-Donating-App
Blood Donating App has been created using the Python language and using the external framework Kivy.
# Over View
We have created a blood donating app in order to provide the fast donation of blood.
This app would contain the data of all types of blood the people are having. 
The blood of donor would be there and according to the receiver if their blood type matches than the blood would be donated as fast as it can according to the desired location. 
This app would automatically allocate rest time to the donors who had donated the blood. 
# Scope
If this app would spread than many lives can be saved as the finding of the perfect blood for donor and the receiver would be there.
A healthy lifestyle would be adopted and for future emergencies there will be no hustle and bustle.
